You are a senior software architect and system design expert.

I‚Äôm building a cutting-edge Connected Healthcare Ecosystem for hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies, doctors, and patients ‚Äî using a robust microservices architecture that‚Äôs scalable, secure, and NDHM/DPDP-compliant. My tech stack includes Node.js (ESM, JS), MongoDB (Mongoose), Docker, Express, and follows modern industry standards like RBAC, JWT, Swagger, and Prometheus monitoring.

üß© High-Level Modules
The ecosystem is broken into the following services:

API Gateway
Central entrypoint for all frontend/mobile clients. Handles routing, authentication, rate-limiting, circuit breaking, and request transformation. Also includes Swagger-based API documentation and Prometheus-compatible metrics.

User Service
Handles registration, login, password reset, KYC verification (Aadhar, PAN, License for doctors), profile management, and role-based access (patient, doctor, admin, pharmacy, lab, etc.).

Appointment Service
Patients can book appointments with doctors across hospitals. Doctors can accept, reject, or reschedule. It supports real-time availability checks, calendar syncing, and audit logging.

Hospital Service
Manages hospitals, departments, and doctor schedules. Doctors are linked to specific hospitals with predefined availability.

Notification Service
Responsible for sending real-time notifications via email, SMS, or push. It‚Äôs decoupled from core services and communicates via REST or future queue integration.

Lab Service
Allows doctors to request lab tests. Labs can upload results (PDF, Excel, etc.), which are automatically synced to the doctor and patient's records ‚Äî eliminating paper-based dependency.

Pharmacy Service
Connected to the prescription module. Doctors prescribe medicines ‚Üí pharmacy fulfills orders ‚Üí system reminds doctor/patient when stock is low.

Billing Service
Handles billing and invoices for appointments, lab tests, and medicines. Auto-generates billing receipts and integrates with payments in future.

Staff Service
Manages hospital employee records, attendance tracking using geofencing/Wi-Fi detection, shift schedules, and soft leave tracking.

File Upload Service
Used for secure, centralized media/document uploads (KYC, lab reports, prescriptions) ‚Äî integrated with Cloudinary or S3. Accepts all MIME types securely.

Audit Service
Logs all critical events (login, appointment creation, KYC approval, etc.) for regulatory compliance (NDHM/DPDP Act). Stores logs with TTL and export options.

Analytics Service
Generates insights: appointments per day, doctor availability, hospital-wise traffic, pending verifications, most prescribed medicines, etc.

Shared Libraries
Common modules like JWT middleware, role checks, constants, helper functions, and custom validators used across services.

üõ° Key Architectural Features
Microservices ‚Äì Every service is independent, containerized, and scalable.

MongoDB ‚Äì Separate DB for each service. Indexed schemas with soft delete.

Dockerized ‚Äì Every service has Dockerfile and is orchestrated via Compose.

Security ‚Äì JWT, Refresh Tokens, Rate Limiting, XSS/NoSQL Injection protection.

Validation ‚Äì Joi or custom validation in each service.

Monitoring ‚Äì Prometheus + Grafana ready via /metrics endpoints.

Testing ‚Äì Jest + Supertest for unit/integration tests.

Dev Tools ‚Äì ESLint, Prettier, .env, and logger setup in every service.

API Documentation ‚Äì Swagger for every service, aggregated at gateway if needed.

üìÅ Additional Context
I‚Äôve attached the entire file structure of the project (final_project_structure_with_files.txt) for you to deeply analyze the project layout, and suggest improvements, test strategies, deployment pipelines, or architecture diagrams.

üîç Instructions
